1. Right-click **Start course** and open the link in a new tab.
1. In the new tab, most of the prompts will automatically fill in for you.
   - For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
   - We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will [use Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).
   - Scroll down and click the **Create repository** button at the bottom of the form.
1. You can now proceed to the üõ†Ô∏è set up section.

## üõ†Ô∏è The set up

#### üñ•Ô∏è Using codespaces

All levels are configured to run instantly with GitHub Codespaces. If you chose to use codespaces, be aware that this course **will count towards your 60 hours of monthly free allowance**. For more information about GitHub Codespaces, see the "[GitHub Codespaces overview](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview)." If you prefer to work locally, please follow the local installation guide in the next section.

1. To create a codespace, click the **Code** drop down button in the upper-right of your repository navigation bar.
1. Click **Create codespace on main**.
1. After creating a codespace, relax and wait for VS Code extensions and background installations to complete. This should take less than three minutes.
1. At this point, you can get started with Levels 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, by navigating on the respective folders and reading the `README.md` file.



#### üíª Dependencies installation

1. Open your terminal.
8. Install dependencies by running:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
You are now ready to play!
