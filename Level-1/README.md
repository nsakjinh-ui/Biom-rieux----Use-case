## Level 1: Cyber Monday

_Welcome to Level 1!_ :chess_pawn:

Languages: `python3`


### 📝 Storyline

Just days before Cyber Monday, an electronics shop rushed its brand-new website online. All the budget went into coding — none into security. The result? A shiny but vulnerable shop. Can you patch the bug, keep the business running, and unlock Level 2?

### :keyboard: What's in the repo?

For each level, you will find the same file structure:

- `code` includes the vulnerable code to be reviewed.
- `hack` exploits the vulnerabilities in `code`. Running `hack.py` will fail initially, your goal is to get this file to pass.
- `tests` contains the unit tests that should still pass after you have implemented your fix.

### 🚦 Time to start!

1. Review the code in `code.py`. Can you spot the bug(s)?
1. Try to fix the bug. Ensure that unit tests are still passing 🟢.
1. You successfully completed the level when both `hack.py` and `tests.py` pass 🟢.
